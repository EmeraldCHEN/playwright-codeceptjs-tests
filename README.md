# playwright-codeceptjs-tests
This project demonstrates how to integrate Playwright's powerful browser automation capabilities with CodeceptJS's high-level testing framework for end-to-end testing of web applications.


- Run tests

```
npx codeceptjs run --steps
```

- For other available commands and options, you can refer to the [CodeceptJS documentation](https://codecept.io).

- Best Practices

-- Keep Tests Modular: Use Page Objects to encapsulate page-specific functionality and keep your test code modular.

-- Organize Locators: Store locators in separate files or use Page Objects to manage them effectively.

-- Maintainable Tests: Write tests that are easy to read and maintain by using descriptive methods and organizing your code logically
